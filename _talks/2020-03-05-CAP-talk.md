Oral talk (â‰ˆ 1 hour with questions and answers) at the Applied Computing Seminar divided into two parts. The first part was about my PhD research, comparing traditional machine learning and deep learning applied to galaxy morphology. On the second part, I talked about computer vision and video analytics projects I've been working on at the Accenture's Applied Intelligence division.
