Two classes (about 1 hour each with questions and answers) at the Video Analytics Academy of Accenture. The first class presented: introduction on machine learning, differences between traditional machine learning and deep learning, preparing the dataset for a learning problem, and main aspects of an artificial neural network. Organized the second class to have three parts, with an overview of different video applications with deep learning, and two hands-on applications (these two workshops were presented by two colleagues).
