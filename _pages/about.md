About me
======
I am a visiting PhD Research Fellow at the Physics Department in [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/) working with Marcelle Soares-Santos. I am a PhD Candidate in Applied Computing at National Institute for Space Research ([INPE-Brazil](http://www.inpe.br/)) -- working with Reinaldo R. Rosa and Reinaldo R. de Carvalho. I am working with different computer science applications in astrophysics. The main investigation of my PhD have been how to substantially improve galaxy morphology classification within large datasets by mimicking human classification. I combine accurate visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project with machine and deep learning methodologies. The main product of these years of research is a complete catalog with morphology for ≈ 670.000 galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) – which will be published soon ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07047)).

I am a current active member of the Dark Energy Survey ([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)) collaboration. DES is a good example of how computationally challenging modern astrophysics and cosmology are. I am debugging and documenting the trasient detection system for gravitational waves. Also, I am helping to improve the usability of the cluster finding and characterization system. 

I have been working with machine learning related topics since undergrad (starting in 2009, at [UFSCar](https://www2.ufscar.br/foreign-visitor/about-ufscar)). My first scientific research contributed to a machine translation project which aligned two different semantic networks (ConceptNets – en-us and pt-br). For my Master’s project (2012-2015), I worked on a machine called [NELL: Never-Ending Learning Language](https://rtw.ml.cmu.edu). NELL is continuously reading the web and deciding to learn or not new concepts with an automatic supervision from its own knowledge base. The main contribution of my Master’s thesis was providing the refactored and improved version of the main component for NELL’s ontology extension: newOntExt. I also have worked in different companies (industry) as a System Analyst ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulobarchi)).
