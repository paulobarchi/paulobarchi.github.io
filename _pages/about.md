![research](../images/research2.jpg) <sub>Main investigation of my PhD -- Machine and Deep Learning Applied to Galaxy Morphology ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07047) | [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133719300757)).</sub>

About me
======
I am currently working with RD&I in Applied Intelligence at Accenture focused on Deep Learning-based Computer Vision and Video Analytics. Day-to-day tasks:
- Overcome challenges related to object detection, pose detection, tracking, activity recognition.
- Contribute on developing the necessary architecture to handle data input, pre-processing, labeling, data augmentation, and analysis as well for the end-to-end software product (Test Driven Development).
- Keep up with state-of-art literature on Deep Learning and Computer Vision;
- Lead paper submissions for peer-reviewed events.

Finished my PhD in Applied Computing at National Institute for Space Research ([INPE-Brazil](http://www.inpe.br/)) on March, 2020. Former PhD Research Fellow at the Physics Department in [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/) supervised by Marcelle Soares-Santos. The main investigation of my PhD have been how to substantially improve galaxy morphology classification within large datasets by mimicking human classification. I combine accurate visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project with machine and deep learning methodologies. The main product of these years of research is a complete catalog with morphology for ≈ 670.000 galaxies from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) -– [Astronomy&Computing](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2019.100334).

I have been working with machine learning related topics since undergrad (starting in 2009, at [UFSCar](https://www2.ufscar.br/foreign-visitor/about-ufscar)). My first scientific research contributed to a machine translation project which aligned two different semantic networks (ConceptNets – en-us and pt-br). For my Master’s project (2012-2015), I worked on a machine called [NELL: Never-Ending Learning Language](https://rtw.ml.cmu.edu). NELL is continuously reading the web and deciding to learn or not new concepts with an automatic supervision from its own knowledge base. The main contribution of my Master’s thesis was providing the refactored and improved version of the main component for NELL’s ontology extension: newOntExt. I also have worked in different companies (industry) as a System Analyst ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulobarchi)).
